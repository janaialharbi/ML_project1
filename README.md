- *Final Project Jupyter.ipynb*: The main notebook containing the analysis, preprocessing, and model-building steps.
- *README.md*: This file.
- *heart.csv*: Primary dataset for the project.
- *heart_cleveland_upload.csv*: Secondary dataset for validation or further analysis.

## Requirements
Install the required libraries using:
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


## Running the Notebook
